# Hello world

This site is still a work in progress (and probably will be forever), but here's the place I plan to
write some blogs, show off my work/projects and generally express what I am thinking about. 

The posts are all written in Markdown, available on GitHub[0], and built using the site generator
Marmite[1]. (It's a pretty cool tool, check it out!) 

Anyway, welcome to my site. Enjoy your stay :wave:
